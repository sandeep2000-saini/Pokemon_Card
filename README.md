this is a Pokemon_Card project not to-do list project <br/>


Pokémon Card Search App is an interactive web project that showcases a collection of Pokémon character cards, each displaying key details like name, power, and other attributes. The core feature of this project is its intelligent search functionality — users can type one or more letters, and the app instantly filters and displays matching Pokémon cards whose names contain the typed characters. This real-time, dynamic search experience was designed to be fast, intuitive, and user-friendly. <br/>
